# SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL** on a relational database consisting of **customer, product, and transactional fact tables**. The objective is to understand data patterns, evaluate key metrics, and extract meaningful business insights.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The database contains three main tables:

* **Customer Table (Dimension):** Stores customer-related attributes.
* **Product Table (Dimension):** Stores product-related details.
* **Fact Table:** Contains transactional data linking customers and products.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **SQL** (for data querying and analysis)
* Relational Database concepts (Fact & Dimension tables)

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

* Joined fact and dimension tables to create a unified analytical view.
* Analyzed trends, distributions, and key performance metrics.
* Examined customer behavior and product performance.
* Summarized large datasets to derive actionable insights.

## 📈 Insights Generated

* Identified patterns in transactional data.
* Evaluated product contribution to overall performance.
* Gained insights into customer segmentation and purchasing behavior.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project demonstrates the application of **SQL for real-world data analysis**, focusing on structured querying, data exploration, and insight generation suitable for business decision-making.
